        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `syronex_colorpicker`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`syronex_colorpicker`: http://www.syronex.com/software/jquery-color-picker
        
        To include the colorpicker resource, call
        
            js.jqueryui_syronex_colorpicker.colorpicker.need()
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jqueryui_syronex_colorpicker``) are published to some URL.
        
        The provided colorpicker code is licenced under GPL, the integration code uses
        a BSD Licence.
        
        The provided code does not provide a version number, so we declare this as
